These are companying simulation codes of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04665) `Gaussian Process Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Safe Interactions of a Platoon of Autonomous and Human-Driven Vehicles`. The project is actively being updated. 

## ARX_simulation
This contains the MPC with ARX model and ARX+GP as the simulation plant.
`MPC_Platoon_simulation` is the main file, `MPC_Platoon` is the MPC, and `GP_sysmodel` is the system model for simulations. 

## GP_ARX_simulation
It contains the MPC with ARX+GP model and ARX+GP as the simulation plant.
`GP_MPC_Platoon_simulation` is the main file, `GP_MPC_Platoon` is the GP-MPC, and `GP_sysmodel` is the system model for simulation.
